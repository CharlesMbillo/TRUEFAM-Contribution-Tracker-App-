# TRUEFAM Bereavement Campaign Contribution Tracker

Automate the tracking of contributions for bereavement campaigns by capturing payment notifications from Zelle, Venmo, Cash App, and M-PESA. This app extracts key details such as sender name, amount, member ID, and date from both SMS and email notifications, then updates a specified Google Sheet in real-time.

- **Google Sheets Integration:** Appends new rows to a Google Sheet with each parsed contribution.
